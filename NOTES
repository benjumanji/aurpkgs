		starts OK
		/manager OK

	Check that when uninstalled, dir /var/log/tomcat is removed (do we really want it?)
	Rename "tomcat5" + check with update-alternatives

	ISSUE: wab apps /host-manager and /manager don't work
		These are in /usr/share/tomcat/server but tomcat looks for apps in /srv/tomcat/webapps
		Should they be somewhere else? Check in Deb and RedHat

tomcat-admin
	signoff i686
		/admin OK
	Rename "tomcat5-admin" + check with update-alternatives
