What is alternatives
	aka update-alternatives in Debian/Ubuntu [TODO give URLs]
	application for managing different versions of the same application
	[TODO give redhat's man page URL]
	[TODO give examples]

How this package was created
	C sources RedHat's chkconfig [TODO give URL of sources]
	kept only 'alternatives' files
	made PKGBUILD based on makefile

Warning about it's use in ArchLinux
	This ArchLinux package is a 'proof of concept': the binaries provided work
	but the applications managed by 'alternatives' need to be packaged in a particular way
	such as the different versions of applications do not interfere whith each other
	(and the package manager does not 'replace' old versions).
	This implies that applications need to be packaged in version specific directories like:
	/usr/share/my-app_$pkgver.
	As packages are not made with this requirement in ArchLinux, you will not be able to use
	'alternatives' with regular ArchLinux packages. However this 'alternative' will work
	with any manually managed applications.

So what is the use?
	1) "Fun". And I have had some making it :)
	2) Could be usefull to someone that needs to manage different versions of its own scripts/applications or (less likely to happen) custom installed software.
	3) Could be an open door to packaging applications in AL bearing in mind this version

Last warning about testing
	This binary only handles links to applications so it should not be of great harm to your system. However I have not been able to test it extensively. I am thus interested in feedback about fail or success stories. Feel free to leave a comment on the ArchLinux User Repository page of the package [TODO give URL].
